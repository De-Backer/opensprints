printing:
To print a drawing of the layout, print to pdf with X and Y scaling 1.0. Then print the generated PDF at 1.077 scale.

To make the TO-92 footprint module compatible with the MOSFET_N symbol, I created a custom module version of the TO-92 footprint and renamed the pads 1,2,3 to D,G,S.

The mounting hole is a single pad with diameter 0.26" with a pad diameter 0.26".

TO DO:
 * change pad sizes to hole diameter = 0.035" and pad diameter = 0.070"
 * draw all the tracks
